# Troubleshooting

## The script says ReaImGui is missing

- First confirm that `Extensions -> ReaPack -> Browse Packages...` exists in REAPER.
- If it does not, install ReaPack first and restart REAPER.
- Then open ReaPack inside REAPER.
- Install `ReaImGui: ReaScript binding for Dear ImGui`.
- Restart REAPER.

## The script asks to run bootstrap

- Make sure you are running the script from an unpacked GitHub release ZIP or from a development checkout.
- Run `scripts/bootstrap.command`.
- Confirm that `config.json` exists in the REAPER user data directory.
- This step also downloads and verifies the PANNs checkpoint automatically.
- Do not point the script at a system Python manually; it expects the managed runtime under `Data/reaper-panns-item-report/runtime/venv`.
- For development-only editable installs, run `scripts/bootstrap_runtime.sh --dev`.

## Bootstrap says `python3.11 was not found`

- Install Python `3.11` first.
- Recommended macOS options:
  - install from the official [Python macOS downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)
  - or install with Homebrew: `brew install python@3.11`
- Open a new Terminal window and run `python3.11 --version`.
- If that command still fails after a Homebrew install, load your shell environment and try again before rerunning `scripts/bootstrap.command`.

## The runtime falls back to CPU

- On Apple Silicon, this is expected if `MPS` is unavailable or unstable.
- The runtime intentionally prefers a safe fallback over a crash.

## The model download fails

- Check your internet connection.
- Confirm that you are using the unpacked project folder and not launching the Lua file from a temporary preview location.
- Delete the partially downloaded checkpoint from `.local-models/` first, or from the REAPER fallback model directory if bootstrap had to use the fallback path.
- Run `scripts/bootstrap.command` again.

## The selected item is rejected

- Make sure exactly one item is selected.
- Make sure the active take is audio, not MIDI.
- If you already have a report open, keep the window open, select the new item, and click `Another`.

## REAPER becomes sluggish when the report opens

- Make sure you are on the latest version of the script and rerun the action.
- The report now prepares exported audio incrementally. You should briefly see a `Preparing audio...` stage before runtime inference starts.
- If responsiveness still drops, capture the current runtime or export log and note whether the slowdown happens during `Preparing audio...`, during `Listening...`, or only after the final report appears.
- The temporary on-screen diagnostics panel was removed once the atlas-based icon path stabilized, so current troubleshooting relies on the regular logs instead of extra buttons in the report window.

## The compact view does not show the colorful icons

- The current build uses bundled Noto Emoji PNG assets instead of system emoji.
- If the compact chips show text without icons, the image decode/render path is unavailable in that REAPER session.
- Analysis quality is unaffected; this is only a presentation fallback.
- Restarting the script is usually enough to restore the image path if the session was in a bad UI state.

## I want to inspect export diagnostics without running the model

- Run `reaper/REAPER Audio Tag - Debug Export.lua`.
- It exports the selected take range, writes a diagnostics log, and stops before the Python runtime step.

## I am worried about temporary files

- The script only creates temporary WAVs, job files, and logs inside the REAPER app data directory.
- Those temporary artifacts are cleaned up automatically after completed runs, retries, `Another`, and window close.
- Original source audio files and project media are never deleted.

## The tags feel too generic

- The current runtime does clip-level tagging only.
- Audio is downmixed to mono and resampled to `32 kHz` before inference.
- The report is best used as a fast cueing tool, not as a precise event detector.
